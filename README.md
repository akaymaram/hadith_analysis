The MIS dataset represent directed graph which consists of 2092 nodes, representing individual narrators, and 77,797 edges represent the Sanad-Hadith connections. The MIS dataset represents multiple ISNAD of the Hadith based on the Sahih Muslim Hadith book.  four different tools The dataset was carefully extracted from online multiple Hadith sources using data scraping and web crawling techniques tools, providing extensive Hadith details.  four different tools: NetworkX, Neo4j graph database, and two different network analysis tools named Gephi and CytoScape
